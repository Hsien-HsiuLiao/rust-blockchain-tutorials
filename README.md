# Decentralized Application (dApp) Blockchain Tutorials  
These video-based(youtube) tutorials attempt to choose something somewhat challenging but at the same time go at a slow pace and try to go over basics.  
<br/>
The approach is to:
- constantly ask "what, why, how"
- try the most minimalist code unless it doesn't make sense to
- use the "onion" - sometimes we go deep into one topic, and at other times it's very shallow but we cover various topics

## NEAR Blockchain Tutorial (Deploying WASM)

Between Part 1 and 2, we arrive at the conclusion to focus on Rust, and start with WASM blockchains.

This video delves into why I chose to learn decentralized blockchain programming (dApps)

We come across an online tutorial from [NEAR](https://near.org/) and use that as our jumping-off point.  

Once we'v gotten our local development environment set up, we work on our "smart contract" program that we will deploy and run on a NEAR testnet blockchain.

[Here](https://github.com/elicorrales/rust-near-blockchain) is the code as we conclude this series.  
<br/>
Note that in this first series, we use only the "near-cli" tool to deploy and interact with our on-chain(deployed) smart-contract program.  
We don't worry or are aware of what "magic" takes place that helps us interact with our deployed program.  
<br/>
In the next series we delve into the what/how of command-line client required to interact with a blockchain program.

## Solana Blockchain Tutorial (Deploying eBPF)
<br/>

This series differs from the NEAR blockchain series in several ways:
- We are deployin eBPF programs, not WASM
- We deploy to a local test blockchain
- We also delve into writing a command-line Node.js Javascript client
- We use VSCode to debug

<br/>
Hopefully most of the youtube titles are self-explanatory.
